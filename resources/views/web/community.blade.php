                        <p>From the very beginning, Gabriel Pizza has been committed to being part of our community and giving back. Each day, we strive to build a stronger community by supporting organizations, educational institutions, charities, and neighbourhood events. We are honoured of our conscious, and supportive community – and like you, we aspire to put a smile on people’s faces and make a difference in those lives.</p>
                        <p>Big or small, Gabriel Pizza is proud to support many initiatives throughout our community:</p>
                        <p><strong>Ottawa Hospital Staff Appreciation Week</strong></p>
                        <p>Every year during Staff Appreciation Week, Gabriel Pizza says thank-you to all the hard-working staff at each campus of the Ottawa Hospital. Over 28,000 slices of pizzas are donated to the 14,000 employees as our way of showing our appreciation to their efforts.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we support every hospital in our area. Whether it is to say thank-you for their commitment to their community, or to support the care of patients, we are there to show our pizza-love.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Music Vibe</strong></p>
                        <p>RBC Bluesfest, City Folk, Ottawa Dragon Boat Race Festival, Ottawa Jazz Festival, HOPE Beach Volleyball, or Limestone City Blues Festival, we have been part of all of these great musical experiences. You’ll find us at these and other events in your area.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Sports Connection</strong></p>
                        <p>Gabriel Pizza is the official pizza of the Ottawa Senators Hockey Club, Ottawa RedBlacks, Ottawa 67s Hockey Club, Ottawa University Gee Gees, Ottawa Titans Baseball Club, and St. Lawrence College Athletics – just to name a few. We are thrilled to cheer on our teams and their continued success.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Caregiving</strong></p>
                        <p>Ollie’s Pizza was created in tribute to a brave boy named Ollie – who loves Gabes green olives and cheese pizza. Funds raised from Ollie’s Pizza go to Candlelighters – a charity helping families like Ollie’s, who are living with the reality of childhood cancer.</p>
                        <p>We have been there when our community has needed us most. Sometimes it’s challenging to feed a family. We have corroborated with several neighbourhood food banks, men and women’s shelters, and senior organizations to help when needed. We stand committed to doing our part for those less fortunate.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Community Celebrations</strong></p>
                        <p>Cystic Fibrosis Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society, National Nursing Week, Black History Ottawa, our Canadian Military Forces, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, The Ottawa Lebanese Festival, and the Santa Clause Parades are just some of the organizations we sponsor annually. Gabriel Pizza has supported thousands of events and fundraising initiatives in our community. There are just too many charities and not-for-profit organizations to name, but rest assured, you will find us proudly supporting the efforts and commitments of the army of community volunteers that are dedicating their time to make our world a little better.</p>
                        <p>Our local stores also participate in wide range of non-profit and charitable events throughout the year. We encourage you to contact your neighbourhood Gabriel Pizza location.

                        <p>Let’s continue to build a better community together.</p>
